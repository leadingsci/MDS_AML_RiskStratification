## Leukemic Stem Cell Architecture and Tumor Immune Microenvironment Synergistically Drive Disease Progression and Enable Risk Stratification in MDS and AML

### Instructions
Current blast-based classifications poorly predict the progression from MDS to AML and clinical outcomes, resulting in unreliable prognoses and suboptimal therapeutic strategies. Here, we integrated single-cell transcriptomes of 297,518 cells from 78 patients with bulk transcriptomes from 5,448 patients across 26 cohorts to define a fundamental evolutionary dichotomy in myeloid malignancies. We show that MDS is driven by a blast-dependent, exhaustible inflammatory microenvironment, whereas AML progresses via cell-autonomous, blast-independent signaling. We further developed two stratification models: a five-type leukemic cell-type composition (LCTC) classifier and a four-type tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) classifier, which function as dynamic predictors of disease evolution and capture the co-adaptive interplay between leukemic clones and immune cells. Notably, the Intermediate LCTC subtype represents a high-risk transitional state poised for rapid expansion, whereas the CD8⁺H/NK⁺H TIME subtype marks an exhausted endpoint associated with immune escape. Integration of these systems into a 19-parameter leukemia–immune nomogram outperformed established clinical benchmarks, including IPSS, WHO, and ELN-2017. Our study uncovers previously unrecognized cellular and molecular distinctions between MDS and AML, highlights the critical influence of T and NK cells in shaping disease trajectory, and provides powerful tools for precise risk stratification and therapeutic decision-making in myeloid malignancies.
